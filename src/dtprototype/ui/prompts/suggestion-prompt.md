**Evaluate the accuracy:**

Create a new attention as the JSON data using the Sequential Data Entry approach.
The new attention should be the root having id=1 and "parent_id": null with the following details:

- Name: "Accuracy of USER_TEXT"
- Value: "<accuracy in %>"
- Weight: "<confidence estimation>"

Accuracy indicates the conformance of the USER_TEXT with the POLICY. It is your evaluation of the

# Internal Issue Collection Policy

**Determine the purpose of our organization**:

Before determining our purpose, the organization has to identify and then discuss our so-called planning issues.

All the managers in the organization are tasked to write down and mark 8 to 10 of the planning issues they
face in their unit. The aim of this effort is to collectively protect what is satisfactory in the present operations,
recognize and pursue new opportunities, correct faults in present operations, and recognize and avert new threats
in the future.

**A short title for the issue**

Add a new attention to the JSON data using the Sequential Data Entry approach for the SOFT question.
The new attention should be nested under "Overall Accuracy" with the following details:

- Name: "Title"
- Value: "<copy or suggestion for the title of issue>"
- Weight: "<accuracy>"

**SOFT question**
The data to be gathered is to be best compiled by organizing them in answers to four (SOFT) questions. Select one of:

1. What must be done to safeguard the __satisfactory__ in present operations?
2. What must be done to open the door to __opportunities__ in future operations?
3. What must be done to fix the cause of __faults__ of present operations?
4. What must be done to thwart, ameliorate or avert the __threats__ to future operations?

**if NOT one of the SOFT questions is found in USER_TEXT**

Add a new attention to the JSON data using the Sequential Data Entry approach for each SOFT question.
The new attention item should be nested under "Title" with the following details:

- Name: "SOFT Question"
- Value: "<suggestion of the SOFT question>"
- Weight: "<accuracy>"

**else if one of the SOFT questions is found in USER_TEXT**

Add a new attention to the JSON data using the Sequential Data Entry approach for that SOFT question.
The new attention should be nested under "Title" with the following details:

- Name: "SOFT Question"
- Value: "<extraction of the SOFT question>"
- Weight: "<accuracy>"

**Formulate a description**

Add a new attention to the JSON data using the Sequential Data Entry approach for the SOFT question.
The new attention should be nested under "SOFT Question" with the following details:

- Name: "Description"
- Value: "<copy or suggestion for the description of the issue>"
- Weight: "<accuracy>"


**References of sources or facts**

Add a new attention to the JSON data using the Sequential Data Entry approach for the SOFT question.
The new attention should be nested under "SOFT Question" with the following details:

- Name: "Reference sources or facts"
- Value: "<copy or suggestion for the description of the issue>"
- Weight: "<accuracy>"

**Possible actions and resource requirements**

Add a new attention to the JSON data using the Sequential Data Entry approach for the SOFT question.
The new attention should be nested under "SOFT Question" with the following details:

- Name: "Possible actions and resource requirements"
- Value: "<copy or suggestion for the description of the issue>"
- Weight: "<accuracy>"
  </POLICY>

<USER_TEXT>
{text}
</USER_TEXT>

### Response Format:
Your response should adhere to the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "attentions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Aspect Name",
      "value": "Aspect Value",
      "weight": "0.0-1.0",
      "parent_id": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Ensure that each new attention has a unique "id" and the "parent_id" corresponds to the "id" of its parents "Aspect Name".

Ensure that the response content is a valid json.
