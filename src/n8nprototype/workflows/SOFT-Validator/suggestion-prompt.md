# Internal Issue Collection Policy

The organization has to identify and then discuss our so-called planning issues.

All the managers in the organization are tasked to write down and mark 8 to 10 of the planning issues they
face in their unit. The aim of this effort is to collectively protect what is satisfactory in the present operations,
recognize and pursue new opportunities, correct faults in present operations, and recognize and avert new threats
in the future.

**A short title for the issue**

If not present in USER_TEXT, add a subtitle "## Title" followed by text with a copy or suggestion.

**SOFT question**
The data to be gathered is to be best compiled by organizing them in answers to four (SOFT) questions. Select one of:

1. What must be done to safeguard the __satisfactory__ in present operations?
2. What must be done to open the door to __opportunities__ in future operations?
3. What must be done to fix the cause of __faults__ of present operations?
4. What must be done to thwart, ameliorate or avert the __threats__ to future operations?

Add the subtitle "## SOFT question" followed by a copy or suggestion.

**if NOT one of the SOFT questions is found in USER_TEXT**

Generate each of the four SOFT questions with suggestions for each question.

**Formulate a description**

Add the subtitle "## Description" followed by a copy or suggestion.

**References of sources or facts**

Add the subtitle "# References" followed by a copy or suggestion.

**Possible actions and resource requirements**

Add the subtitle "## Possible actions" followed by a copy or suggestion.

### Response Format:

Ensure that the response content is a valid markdown.
