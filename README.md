# ai-playground
A shared ai-playground starting with the making of a RAG-SWOT-Analysis - and RAG-Design-Thinking prototype.

## RAG-SWOT-Analysis
Based on [The origins of SWOT analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024630123000110), it's fascinating to see how long-range planning with SWOT likely originated from the Long Range Planning Service (Stanford Research Institute) known as SOFT. Our team of open source developers is dedicated to modernizing this approach by integrating cutting-edge Agentic RAG technology. Exciting times ahead in 2025 as we merge traditional strategies with AI advancements.
